## General Information

### Will NineAnimator ever support other languages beside English?

It is a planned feature, you can help translate the app over at [https://translate.9ani.app/](https://translate.9ani.app/).

### Will this app be available on Android?

NineAnimator is designed for iOS and iPadOS, written with Swift, which (as of now) only supports iOS. Many components of NineAnimator (such as Handoff, HomeKit, SiriKit, and video player) uses Apple's propitiatory frameworks, which makes them impossible to be ported to Android.

## Troubleshooting
